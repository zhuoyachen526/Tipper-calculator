## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

When building Tipper, I felt user interaction related functions like onTap, calculateTip are very important and challenging. I can't do it without learning from the walkthrough video. I also learned how to use picker view and let users set different currencies conveniently. In general, it's a very small but useful app and I learned a lot about swift syntax, iOS app layout design and how to connect different labels and text views and use them to achieve some functionalities.
